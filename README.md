These files simulate a blockchain. Notably this
demo shows a simplification of some of the
harder to understand details in order to shed
light. Key elements that can be seen here:

1. How Ethereum prevents double spending
2. How the proof-of-work algorithm creates blocks
3. How blocks are chained together
4. How accounts update state

# Quick Use
1. clone and cd into folder
2. type `python3 BlockchainDemo.py`

3. mine first block -> choose '8' from option menu
4. add account -> choose '1' or '2'

5. bradcast txn -> choose '3' (follow prompts)
6. view txns -> choose '5' (txn should appear)
